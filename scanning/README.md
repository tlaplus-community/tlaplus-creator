# Scanning Tutorial Code

Snapshot of the code produced in the [scanning tutorial](https://docs.tlapl.us/creating:scanning).
Also a backup of the tutorial page itself.
The script `run.sh` contains simple example commands for building & running the code, assuming you have `javac` and `java` on your path.
