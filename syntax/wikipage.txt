====== Parsing TLA⁺ Expressions ======

Outline:
  - Section 5.1.3: provide grammar for TLA⁺ expressions
  - Class & output package name only changes to GenerateAst.java
  - In AstPrinter, change package name, remove floats, add column arg to Token
  - Need to change expression levels to correspond to TLA+ precedences
  - Associativity restrictions? Precedence conflict restrictions?
    + ENABLED and PRIME should conflict
    + PLUS and MINUS should also conflict I think
  - In error(), rename Lox to TlaPlus
  - What does the synchronize() method look like?
  - 

Changes to scanner:
  - Add feature: negative prefix operator
  - Add feature: land & lor infix operators
  - Add feature: parentheses for expression grouping
  - Bug: ENABLED is tokenized as ELSE
