====== Parsing TLA⁺ Expressions ======

Outline:
  - Section 5.1.3: provide grammar for TLA⁺ expressions
  - Class & output package name only changes to GenerateAst.java
  - In AstPrinter, change package name, remove floats, add column arg to Token
  - Need to change expression levels to correspond to TLA+ precedences
  - Associativity restrictions? Precedence conflict restrictions?
    + ENABLED and PRIME should conflict
    + PLUS and MINUS should also conflict I think
  - In error(), rename Lox to TlaPlus
  - What does the synchronize() method look like?
  - Finite set literal
  - if/then/else
  - Should be delayed:
    + Prime postfix operator, since it is useless in expressions
    + Function construction, since it uses vars
    + Quantification, since it uses vars
    + Function application, since it uses functions

Changes to scanner:
  - Add feature: negative prefix operator
  - Add feature: land & lor infix operators
  - Add feature: parentheses for expression grouping
  - Bug: ENABLED is tokenized as ELSE
  - Change NAT_NUMBER to NUMBER
